```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE)
templar::versions(folders = list(A = "Version A", B = "Version B",
                               solution_A = "Solutions", solution_B = "Solutions"))
```

## Question 1: Means

```{r, eval = TRUE}
knitr::current_input()
```


Find the mean of the vector `a`

```{r, version = "A"}
set.seed(123)
```

```{r, version = "B"}
set.seed(456)
```

```{r, version = c("A", "B")}
42
```

```{r}
a <- rnorm(10)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, version = "none"}
# placeholder
a <- 1
```

`r mean(a)`

%%%
version: A

Take the mean yo
%%%

%%%
version: solution

The mean is `r mean(a)`
%%%

%%%
version: solution_A

oh hello solutions A
%%%

%%%
version: solution_A, solution_B

lol solutions
%%%



%%%
version: none

Note to self: make a version C
%%%
