3.  Each of you, choose a favorite color from [this list](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf). Each of you share how comfortable you are with R on a scale of 1-10.

Edit the code below so that it has your names and corresponding comfort levels.

```{r, version = "R"}
#| label: group_info-r
group_data <- tibble(
  names = c("Person 1", "Person 2", "Person 3", "Person 4"),
  colors = c("goldenrod", "goldenrod", "goldenrod", "goldenrod"),
  comfort = c(1, 3, 10, 5)
)
```

```{python, version = "python"}
#| label: group_info-py
group_data = {
  'names': ["Person 1", "Person 2", "Person 3", "Person 4"], 
  'colors': ["goldenrod", "goldenrod", "goldenrod", "goldenrod"],
  'comfort': [1, 3, 10, 5]

```{r group_plot, version = "R"}
#| label: plot-r
#| fig-cap: "Our comfort levels with R"
group_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = names, y = comfort, fill = names)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = group_data$colors)
```

```{python, version = "python"}
#| label: plot-py
#| fig-cap: "Our comfort levels with python"
plt.bar(x = group_data['names'], height = group_data['comfort'], color = group_data['colors'])
plt.ylabel("Comfort with python")
plt.show()
