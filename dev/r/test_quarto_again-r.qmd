1.  Write the names of your group members below, as a bullet point list.

2.  Find something that all of you enjoy for fun. Insert a related picture or meme below.


3.  Each of you, choose a favorite color from [this list](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf). Each of you share how comfortable you are with R on a scale of 1-10.

Edit the code below so that it has your names and corresponding comfort levels. 


```{r}
#| label: group_info-r
group_data <- tibble(
  names = c("Person 1", "Person 2", "Person 3", "Person 4"),
  colors = c("goldenrod", "goldenrod", "goldenrod", "goldenrod"),
  comfort = c(1, 3, 10, 5)
)
```



4.  Click "Render" and see the plot that is produced.

(Do not edit the code chunk below!)

```{r group_plot}
#| label: plot-r
#| fig-cap: "Our comfort levels with R"
group_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = names, y = comfort, fill = names)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = group_data$colors)
```
