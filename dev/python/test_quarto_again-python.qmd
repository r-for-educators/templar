```{python}

#| include: false
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

1.  Write the names of your group members below, as a bullet point list.

2.  Find something that all of you enjoy for fun. Insert a related picture or meme below.




3.  Everyone decide your comfort level on a scale of 1-10 in python, and your favorite colors from [this](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/color/named_colors.html) list.

Edit the code below so that it has your names and corresponding comfort levels. 


```{python}
#| label: group_info-py
group_data = {
  'names': ["Person 1", "Person 2", "Person 3", "Person 4"], 
  'colors': ["goldenrod", "goldenrod", "goldenrod", "goldenrod"],
  'comfort': [1, 3, 10, 5]
  }
```

4.  Click "Render" and see the plot that is produced.

(Do not edit the code chunk below!)


```{python}
#| label: plot-py
#| fig-cap: "Our comfort levels with python"
plt.bar(x = group_data['names'], height = group_data['comfort'], color = group_data['colors'])
plt.ylabel("Comfort with python")
plt.show()
```
